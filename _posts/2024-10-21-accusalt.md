In terms of design, this thing is my favorite:

![Accu-Salt Salt Dispenser](/assets/accusalt-dispenser.png){:.w50}

It's a Sonoco Accu-Salt Salt Dispenser. Yes, it's the exact tool they use to salt fries at McDonald's.

![Trump w/ dispenser](/assets/trump-salt.png){:.w75}

It was designed to solve one problem: *consistently* salting fries. It's actually quite difficult to consistently dispense the perfect amount of salt, even more so in a fast-paced service environment. There's no time to measure ingredients, and some workers are bound to be more heavy-handed than others. 

The Accu-Salt solves this while being foolproof to operate.

1. You flip the salt dispenser over some food.
2. A pre-determined amount of salt is dispensed, stopping automatically.
3. You flip the dispenser back over.
4. It's now "reloaded" and ready to be flipped over again.

I took some time to figure out how it works. Essentially, it's comprised of inner shell and an outer shell. 

When the dispenser is flipped over, the salt in the outer shell rushes out.

When the dispenser is flipped back, the salt in the inner shell refills the outer shell.

Now, it's ready to be used again.

It's such an elegant piece of engineering. No moving parts during operation. Inexpensive injection-molded plastic. And anyone can learn to use it after 5 seconds of observation.

I know it's just a fast food salt dispenser, but well-designed items like these make me so optimistic. There are still so many clever ideas hidden in plain sight, no fancy new technology needed.
