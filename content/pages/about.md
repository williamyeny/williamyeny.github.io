I am a programmer based in New York City. Currently, I work on the Applied AI team at [Ramp](https://ramp.com). Previously, I was a founding engineer at a small startup that Ramp acquired. I graduated from Duke.

This site is built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) and served by Github Pages. The styling is written by myself, though it takes serious inspiration from the personal sites of [Paco Coursey](https://paco.me) and [Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me). [The code is open-sourced on GitHub](https://github.com/williamyeny/williamyeny.github.io); you may do whatever you wish with it.
