        <h2>What the heck is this?</h2>
        <div class="cont">
          <p>Garlicbot is totally awesome Twitter bot that automatically retweets tweets that have "garlic" in them! It will also occaisonally follow people with "garlic" in their name.</p>

        <h2>But... why?</h2>
        <div class="cont">
          <p>I'm furiously passionate about garlic, and it saddens me to know that garlic does not get the recognition it needs. Please help raise awareness to garlic by supporting your local supermarket today!</p>

        <h2>How was it made?</h2>
        <div class="cont">
          <p>It was made using Ruby and the Twitter API</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="sec">
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <div class="cont">
          <p>It loops through the tweets containing "garlic" using the Twitter API. If "garlic" is present in the someone's screen name, garlicbot follows them. If a user is trying to reply to someone with "garlic" in their screen name, garlicbot also tries to follow the person with "garlic" in their name. If "garlic" is in the tweet, it retweets them. Everything repeats every 30 seconds</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="sec">
        <h2>If I tweet "garlic" or my name has "garlic" in it, will garlicbot retweet/follow me?</h2>
        <div class="cont">
          <p>If you're active, maybe. Remember, garlicbot only retweets every 30 seconds, so it can't retweet every single thing</p>
